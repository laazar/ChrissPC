            Fantastic PC that supports all newest standards and is rock solid for many years to
            come. I chose these components as they are brilliant value for money. In a short list
            I'll list it's best key points. I was tempted to get cheaper components and that would save maybe £50 - mostly on graphic card but performance drop is just not worth it - simply these have way better value for money.

                <b>Very good graphic card with 10.79 TFLOPS - where PS5 has 10.29</b>

                    <li>
                        TFLOPS are units of computing power often used to measure how fast a graphic
                        processor is - it doesn't represent everything but gives a rough idea of
                        what's the best case scenario on a well optimised system.

                    details (settings) at full HD screens</b

                    <li>
                        It will be able to play most games at high to very high details in Ultra 4K
                        - all games will run smoothly but for 4K and ultra details (max settings)
                        you looking at £600+ for the card alone - so this is the best for this PC,
                        it will run all games with graphic comperable to PS5 or better and it
                        doesn't brake bank. It should last atleast 3 years - by that I mean running
                        all the new games at high details for next 3 years - then gradually it will
                        become noticable that card gets old - like in 5 years it will probably run
                        brand new games at low to medium details for example

                    is a new graphic slot version and cards don't even use it yet (backwards
                    compatible), it supports DDR5 aswell - brand new RAM memory standard, it has LGA 1700 CPU slot - current and future standard for intel processors so upgrading cpu in the future has plenty of options, it has
                    multiple M2 storage NVME slots and basically it means that this motherboard wont
                    need to be upgraded for next 6-10 years easy</b

                    <li>
                        It is future proofed, it has plenty of space to upgrade storage, it will
                        support all graphic cards that will be released in the future and just has
                        plenty of slots and new technologies - good stuff - safe and robust

                        Corsair is very reputable firm and this PSU is one of their most popular -
                        it should run for atleast 5 years used everyday - some of them run for over
                        a decade, extra power doesn't mean it will consume more- it just means it
                        can give more if needed - for example if you will upgrade graphic card in
                        the future - it has all the important connectors - price difference between
                        550W and this is a mere £12 so no point saving and be forced to buy new one
                        in the future if a need arises

                    >for storage I chose this model - I use it myself for many years and it's solid
                    - very popular and 1TB should be enough for everything - and if not -
                    motherboard has plenty of extra slots to fit more in the future - while keeping
                    this one - so simply buy another one, pop it in, no need to reinstall system</b

                    >For RAM memory - 16GB of rock solid memory from trusted brand - also use this
                    brand myself - 16GB is plenty and if needed in the future - just pop in another
                    identical one (thats important - they got to be the same)</b

        <h3>I do recommend buying case for it - everything should fit in the old one but it would just give it that brand new feeling as all components are just hidden inside, also I didn't go for any fancy RGB colorul lights stuff as it most of the time adds a good couple of £££ on every component. I would recommend this cheap case: <a href="https://www.ebuyer.com/2267577-cit-air-max-airflow-black-atx-gaming-case-cit-airmax-b">Link - £47</a><img src="https://img.ebyrcdn.net/1143916-2267577-800.jpg" alt=""></h3>
